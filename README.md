# Social Network Api

## Description
The purpose of this project was to create a social network api. This project uses Express routing, mongoose, and moment.js. Through the testing with Insomnia, the user is able to create a user, a thought, a reaction to a thought, as well as add a user to a users friends list. The user can update a thought by its id, delete a reaction by its id, and remove a friend from their friends list. The user can remove a user by its id as well. This project was extremely helpful in furthering my knowledge on creating Api's. 

## Usage 
To start the application, run node server.js in the terminal! Use Insomnia for api testing of the GET, POST, PUT and Delete.
